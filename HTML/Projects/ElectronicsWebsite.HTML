        <p>1.<b>Book Name:-</b>1984</p>
        <p><b>Author:-</b>George Orwell</p>

        <p>
          <b>About:-</b>Nineteen Eighty-Four (also published as 1984) is a
          dystopian social science fiction novel and cautionary tale by English
          writer George Orwell. It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker &
          Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime.
          Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass
          surveillance and repressive regimentation of people and behaviours
          within society.[2][3] Orwell, a democratic socialist, modelled the
          authoritarian state in the novel on Stalinist Russia and Nazi
          Germany.[2][3][4] More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth
          and facts within societies and the ways in which they can be
          manipulated.
